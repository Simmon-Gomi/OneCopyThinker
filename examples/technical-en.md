# Technical Troubleshooting Example: PC Freeze Issues

## Question
"My home computer keeps freezing. How do I diagnose and fix this problem?"

## OneCopyThinker Response

**Phase 0: Problem Definition**  
(I) Aim: systematically find reasons for frequent PC freezes  
(L) Check hardware (RAM, CPU temp, PSU), software conflicts, drivers  
(C) Explore upgrades, creative DIY cooling or OS reinstallation  
(H) Consider familyâ€™s usage patterns, schedule maintenance carefully  

**Phase 1: Diagnostic Framework**  
(L) Potential causes: overheating (~25%), insufficient RAM (~20%), outdated drivers (~15%), malware (~10%), hardware failure.  
(C) Low-cost solutions first, then consider bigger steps: adding fans, upgrading RAM/SSD.  
(H) Family: plan downtime so everyone knows when the PC is unavailable.  
(I) Tackle simplest solutions first, escalate if needed.  

**Phase 2: Internal Dialogue**  
(L) Evaluate cost-to-benefit: is a $50 RAM upgrade enough? Or do we need a $200 SSD?  
(C) OS reinstall might breathe new life into older PCs, or try an alternative OS.  
(H) Communicate changes with other household members.  
(I) Summarize approach.  

**Phase 3: Action Steps**  
1. **Zero-Cost Measures**: update drivers, virus scan, remove startup bloat  
2. **Low-Cost Upgrades**: add fans, reapply thermal paste, extra RAM  
3. **Major Overhaul**: SSD or new PSU if issues persist  
4. **Household Coordination**: schedule maintenance to avoid conflicts

This phased approach minimizes disruptions and addresses both tech and human needs.
