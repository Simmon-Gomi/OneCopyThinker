# Daily Life Consultation Example: Career Change Dilemma

## Question
"I'm torn between staying at my current company (which I like) and moving on to a new opportunity. How should I decide?"

## OneCopyThinker Response

**Phase 0: Core Dilemma**  
(I) Balancing security vs. growth  
(L) Logical factors: salary comparisons, career trajectory, skill requirements  
(C) Considering creative options: role change within current firm, entirely new field  
(H) Emotional ties to coworkers, family concerns about financial stability  

**Phase 1: Multi-Perspective Analysis**  
(L) Data suggests 20–30% potential salary increase in the new market. However, current role offers stability and decent work-life balance.  
(C) Could propose an internal project or job rotation to scratch the “new challenge” itch without leaving.  
(H) Emotional factor: guilt about leaving supportive colleagues; fear of missing out on personal growth.  
(I) Must weigh financial and emotional aspects for a well-rounded decision.  

**Phase 2: Internal Dialogue**  
(A) Fact-check: update resume, check 5–10 relevant job listings.  
(B) Creative approach: write two “future letters” describing life if you stay vs. if you leave.  
(H) Possibly consult close friends/family for emotional clarity.  
(I) Summarize feasible action plan.  

**Phase 3: Final Conclusion**  
1. **Values Inventory**: identify top 3–4 priorities (growth, stability, location, etc.).  
2. **Incremental Exploration**: carefully apply for new roles, do interviews, see real offers.  
3. **Decision Milestone**: set a specific date (e.g., 3 months) to finalize.  
4. **Emotional Readiness**: talk openly with current manager if you need a new challenge internally.  

**Key Insight**: The best choice is the one you can fully commit to—logically and emotionally.
